## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B3 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

## Mastery

### Object Oriented Programming

* Students are able to use classes and methods to make abstractions that improve code quality
* Students are able to write classes that demonstrate encapsulation of data
* Students are able to explain how their code achieves abstraction and encapsulation
* Students are able to apply MVC principles to separate responsibilities appropriately

### APIs

* Students are able to expose an API.
* Students are able to consume external APIs

### Testing

* Students are able to test external API consumption
* Students are able to test API exposure

## Functional

### Project Management

* Students implement feedback from a code review to improve quality.
* Students provide feedback in the form of a code review to improve quality and share knowledge.
* Students are able to understand and build on an existing code base

### Self-Directed Learning

* Students formulate questions by synthesizing what was expected vs what was observed.
* Students find resources online or in print to help them learn new technologies.
* Students read documentation and implement strategies described.
* Students ask meaningful questions.
    * Example: Don't ask "How do I get this to work?" Instead, mention what has been tried, what happened, what was expected with a goal of understanding where you have made a wrong assumption.
* Students utilize mentors and other community members to identify and discuss the merits of various implementations.

### APIs

* Students are able to use serializers to format json responses

### Advanced Rails

* Students are able to send email from a Rails app.

### Testing

* Students are able to mock external HTTP requests using Webmock & VCR

### Databases

* Students compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases.
* Students write basic SQL statements without the assistance of an ORM.

## Familiar

### Optimization

* Students are able to explain the scenarios that would benefit from using background workers in Rails.
* Students are able to explain how indexes address slow queries.
* Students are able to avoid N + 1 queries
