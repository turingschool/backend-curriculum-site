# Winter Break

It's important that you keep your skills sharp over the winter break, so we'd like you to spend a little bit of time doing some reading, research, and a little bit of coding.

## Suggestions

* come up with a plan to spread out the work over the break -- don't do it all in one or two days -- but you have to keep those skills sharp!
* consider checking in with your Accountabilibuddy, share your schedule, and help encourage one another to work a little

---


## PD Work

Please make sure that you're caught up on all PD work, career journal, etc..

## Reading, 2 hours

* GraphQL
  * what is it
  * how can it be beneficial over RESTful CRUD endpoints
  * build a list of 3 or more pros/cons of having your team implement GraphQL in the upcoming Consultancy project

Put your work in a gist.


## Research, 2 hours

You know the top 4 projects for the upcoming "Consultancy" group project, but you don't know (yet) which team you'll be on.

Over break, revisit [this page](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/projects/consultancy/ideation) which outlines several places to read about available APIs, and come up with TWO different APIs that you think could be useful/helpful in each of the project ideas. You will discuss these APIs as a team on the first day back in January. Try hitting a few API endpoints in Postman to see how they act, write up what's good/bad. Ideally, aim for 2-3 APIs per project.

Put your work in a gist.


## Coding, 16 hours

OAuth is an important skill to understand and implement. It will be required on your group project coming up and everyone should have practice implementing it. You will be given some ideas on how to mock out the OAuth workflow before the break.

Build a VERY simple Rails app (not an `--api`), and implement GitHub OmniAuth to authenticate a user to view a list of their public repos and a separate list of their private repos. (free accounts include unlimited private repos; make a few private repos that just contain a README)

Create a README for your project which includes screenshots of the functionality.

## Review

Students who would like to review any topics should look into the following:

- Consuming APIs
- Refactoring into the Facade and Service design patterns
- Testing tools for API consumption
- Testing endpoints you created in Rails Engine

## Stretch Goals

Once the above work is complete, if you have additional time that you want to spend exploring other topics, here are some suggestions:

- Deeper styling, Bootstrap etc.
- Try the other explorations from Viewing Party and/or Rails Engine
- Add Endpoints for the other data/resources on those projects
