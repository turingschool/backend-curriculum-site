### Purpose

* **Acknowledging Progress:** This is an opportunity to acknowledge the progress that has been achieved over the course of the mod. The final project should demonstrate your understanding of the learning goals and how to implement them.
* **Interview Prep:** The presentation of the project and the portfolio both provide students the opportunity to practice speaking technically about code implementation and decisions and work on professional storytelling.
* **Direct Feedback:** Instructors will be able to provide direct feedback for the technical and professional presentations respectively. Students will be better prepared for an interview.

### Structure

#### Final Project
* Student directed presentation (15-20 minutes)
* Instructor questions and prodding throughout
* Please see the presentation points listed in this [rubric](../projects/sweater_weather/rubric).

#### Portfolio Presentation
* Student directed presentation (5-10 minutes)
* Instructor feedback (3-5 minutes)

Each student will deliver a 5-10 minute slide presentation in front of an instructor. The presentation consists of a professional presentation that is a reflection on your growth throughout the mod. If you are repeating the module, see the instructions below for repeaters.

Slides can include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s). **Please do not just copy the questions onto the slide with bullet point answers.**

#### Professional Presentation Expectations
The professional presentation should follow a narrative format and address the following points:

* Given the Gear Up discussions you've had with peers what steps are you taking to becoming the developer you want to be?
*For example, has this shaped your interactions in group projects and ensuring that all voices get to be heard or thinking about the accessibility for users and how they may interact with your application*

* Reflecting on your career journal from the module, what is your current approach to pursuing your industries and companies of interest?

* How has feedback impacted your development in this module?
  - How has feedback conversations with peers helped prepare you for your job/career?
  - What is something you've learned about yourself in receiving project feedback?
  - What has been the most valuable piece of feedback you have received?
  - What specific actions are you planning on taking after receiving the feedback from this inning?

* What are some lessons learned that you will take with you into the next inning & into the job?
 *This can be both technical and professional*

* What has your learning trajectory looked like over the past 6 weeks?
