## Retro Guide

During projects, it is important that you meet with your partner or your team to discuss the progress of your project, as well as, at the end of the project reflecting on its completion. These retros provide an opportunity to acknowledge what is working well so you can consciously continue doing what works. It is also important to recognize what is not working or needs improvement, so those issues can be addressed and the whole team can collaborate on a solution.

Below are questions that everyone should address together as a team. If you have a gist where you've been keeping your feedback notes, include notes from your discussion there. Otherwise, there are no deliverables for this activity. 

|   |What went well?|What could be improved?|What did not go well?|What feedback do you have for your teammate(s) that might help them in future projects/on the job?|
