## Evaluation at a High Level

Each category has specific criteria to help guide the "above and beyond" goals.

However, we will not reward "heroics". Staying up late, pulling all-nighters, is not what this project is about. We're here to work together as a team, and solo efforts will generally be discouraged by your project managers.


### Rubric

The rubric consists of 4 categories. To see the checkboxes for each category follow the links below:

- [Feature Delivery](./feature_delivery)
- [Technical Quality](./technical_quality)
- [Testing](./testing)
- [Presentation & Documentation](./presentation_documentation)
