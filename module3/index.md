#### Purpose

  In Module 3, we will look beyond the basics of building Rails web applications with the intent of taking a business need and turning it into working software. Students will be comfortable using agile processes to integrate third party APIs, produce APIs, build Rails applications that consume and process data beyond basic CRUD functionality, and improve the performance of their app through AJAX, caching, and background workers.

#### Success

  Students who successfully complete Module 3 will have demonstrated mastery of Professional Skills and Core Technical Skills.
  [These skills are broken down in detail here along with Portfolio Expectations demonstrating those skills](success).

  For a sense of where your abilities should be by the end of the module, take a look at the [Practice Assessment](lessons/practice_assessment). You will have an opportunity to complete this practice assessment in Week 4. If you'd like to get a sense of the core concepts covered during the module, please feel free to review it at any time.

#### Projects

  This module consists of four projects, two team projects and two personal projects. [Find more details about the projects themselves here](projects_overview).
