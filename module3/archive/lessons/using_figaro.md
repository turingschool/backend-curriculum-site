## Using Figaro

### Learning Goals

* Explain why we need tools like Figaro
* Other strategies that could be used to accomplish the same Goals
* Implement and understand how to use Figaro

### Warmup

* What might be some of the downsides to including our secret keys directly in our code?
* Where else could we keep them?

### Introducing Figaro

Start with the repository that you created during [yesterday's lesson](http://backend.turing.io/module3/lessons/getting_started_with_oauth).

Review the [Figaro documentation](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro), and see if you can answer the following questions:

1. What does Figaro do?
1. What steps can you take to install Figaro?
1. What files are created during this installation?
1. What steps do you need to take to configure Figaro?
1. How do you access your keys in your application once you've configured Figaro?
1. What steps do you need to take if you're pushing to Heroku?
