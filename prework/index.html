title: Turing School Prework
<section id="overview-section">
  <article>
    <h2 id="before">Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Turing! Your pre-work is broken up into a few different sections. Start off with the first week's suggested schedule. Once you've completed everything in the first week's schedule, move on to the Next Steps. If you still have time and would like to learn more, you may move on to the Extend Your Learning section. Before coming to Turing, please remember to complete Task G, the Pre-Work Reflection.

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their early weeks with us.

    <h3>Your Time at Turing</h3>
    <p>
      If you haven't heard already, Turing is a fast-paced learning environment. Our goal is to prepare you to be a successful, employable web developer by the end of your 4th module. Being as fast paced as it is, the prework is essential to prepare you for your learning at Turing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turing isn't just about learning to code. We want to prepare you technically and in professional skills, which includes supporting Turing's mission and vision:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.turing.io/">
      Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    <h3>What is Back-End Development?</h3>
    <p>
      Modern software, and web software especially, is driven by content – without the content, most of it wouldn’t be worth bothering with. And all of that content has to live somewhere. It needs to be stored, retrieved, manipulated, formatted, etc. etc. When we talk about “back-end” programming, we’re often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making this possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storing data and accessing it later</li>
      <li>Verifying that data is accurate</li>
      <li>Manipulating and analyzing data</li>
      <li>Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The “front-end” is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The “back-end” typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, authenticating users, etc.; it’s what happens behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="learning_goals">Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>
      The prework below is intended to take you 7 days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you plan to spend 14 days on this 7-day prework, you should break up the work so that you are doing work and coding every day, even if it is only a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)</li>
      <li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
      <li>Become familiar with some common terminology used in web development</li>
      <li>Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple game (for show and tell)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the <strong>Next Steps</strong> section that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to use as a deeper dive.</p>
    <p>Remember, don't worry if you don't understand 100% of everything. Let's get started!</p>

    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <p>Here are the items you will need to complete the prework:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A computer - preferably a laptop running Mac OSX that is a 2013 model or newer</li>
    </ul>

          <h4>Turing Professional Development Pre-Work</h4>
          <p>
            During your time at Turing, you will participate in our professional development sessions. This is an important part of our curriculum. As a precursor to the work you will do at Turing, complete the exercises listed <a href="../career_development_curriculum/prework/pd_prework">here</a> by <strong>no later</strong> than the Monday before the module starts, 9am.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h4>Gear-Up</h4>
          <p>
            Turing is not just a school where you learn to code. In order to achieve our mission and vision, we have group sessions each week called Gear Up in order to bring community awareness to certain issues in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow the instructions <a href = "../career_development_curriculum/prework/gear_up_prework">here</a>.
            Read and write reflections on two of the articles within throughout the week. Anticipate spending approximately 30 - 45 minutes per article on this task.

          <p>If this is your first time using a Mac instead of a PC or Linux, then watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN0FD8KW2V4" target="_blank">this video</a> about using a Mac.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Daily Warm Up</h4>
          <p>Work through <a href="https://typing.io/" target="_blank">typing.io</a> and <a href="https://brilliant.org/computer-science/computer-science/?subtopic=types-and-data-structures" target="_blank">Algorithmic thinking and logic</a> as described in <a href="#daily">Daily Warm Up</a>.</p>

        <li>
          <h4>Setting up your Environment</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>If you are a Mac user: </strong>follow the directions listed <a href="environment_setup_prework" target="_blank">here</a> to get your computer set up for Turing. You can follow along this video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMkRHW9zE1c">YouTube Link</a>

          <p>
            <strong>If you are a Windows user:</strong> Ruby is trickier to set up on Windows machines. In addition, the commands you'll be using on a Mac while at Turing will be different. In order to get started on a Windows machine, you'll complete the prework using the [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) online IDE by following the instructions below:

          <li>Functions: How do you call a function and store the result in a variable?</li>
          <li>Describe the purpose of the following in Ruby classes: initialize method, new method, instance variables.</li>
          <li>How to Write a Program: Screenhero with your student mentor and share your program. In your Gist, write a bit about what you found most challenging, and most enjoyable, in creating your program.</li>
