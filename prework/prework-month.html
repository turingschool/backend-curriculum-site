title: Turing School Prework
subheading: If You Have A Month
---

Welcome to Turing! Your pre-work is broken up into a few different sections. Start off with the first week's suggested schedule. Once you've completed everything in the first week's schedule, move on to the Next Steps. If you still have time and would like to learn more, you may move on to the Extend Your Learning section. Before coming to Turing, please remember to complete Task G, the Pre-Work Reflection.

<h1> Priorities: </h1>

This will make it easier for you and your mentor to know what Gist responses go with which tasks. <strong>Note:</strong> When adding images to your Gist, make sure they are saved as a .jpg or a .png file.</td>

      <strong>If you are a Windows user:</strong> Ruby is trickier to set up on Windows machines. In addition, the commands you'll be using on a Mac while at Turing will be different. In order to get started on a Windows machine, you'll complete the prework using the [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) online IDE by following the instructions below:

<li>Click "Try it Now"</li>
<li>Fill in username, email, and password</li>
<li>Click "Create your free account"</li>
<li>Click "Go to your dashboard"</li>
<li>Click "Create a new workspace"</li>
<li>In "Workspace name", type "turing-prework"</li>
<li>Don't fill in or select anything else; just click "Create workspace" at the bottom</li>
<li>Wait for your workspace to load </li>
<li>The navy blue box at the bottom is your command line (referred to as "Terminal" in some reference materials). The sidebar on the left-hand side is your file tree. The area in the middle is your text editor. </li>

<li> What topics would you most like to see reinforced by instructors?</li>
<li> What is most confusing to you about what you've learned?</li>
<li> What questions do you have for your student mentor or for your instructors?</li>
