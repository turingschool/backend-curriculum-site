On Monday after you leave Turing, you'll wake up in the morning (or the afternoon) and for maybe the first time in 7 months you'll find yourself not having a project due, a lesson to attend or intermission work to procrastinate on doing.

The goal of this assignment is to prepare you mentally for the change and to give you some tools to stay on track to be successful in your first year of life as a developer.

## Deliverables

At the end of the assignment - you will need to submit your own 'Plan' - by using the [template](template.markdown) in this folder. Complete at least **2** assignments - the first is the goals assignment and the others are your choice. Include them in your submission.

If you would prefer your plan not be a public document, create it as a private gist and DM it to your instructor.


### Goals Assignment (required)

After graduation, you should probably throw your laptop in a river and take a day or two off to climb mountains, sit on beaches, play legos with your kids or adult roommates, sleep, etc.

But after that break, you'll need to fish your laptop out of the river and get back on track.

The pace of development life will 'hopefully' never be as intense again as it was at Turing - but if you don't keep learning, your development chops will atrophy.

### Informational Interviews (required)

Now that you're 'on your own', you'll want to start networking in a low-stress, low pressure sorta way. Informational interviews are a good way to do this. We covered this stuff in our PD sessions. You are required to get 3 informational interviews by the end of your first 7 weeks off.

If it were me I would assign myself due dates like:

End of week 2 - one informational interview
End of week 3 - two additional informational interviews
End of week 4 - three additional informational interviews

That way you can have a little leeway should you not get an interview one week. These interviews should not be terribly hard to get since they are only informational.

### Blog Post (required)

Keep fresh on things and keep your voice active in the community. This blogpost will be either the open-source contribution post, or a technical post (whichever you did not do for the portfolio in mod4).

### The 'Side Hustle' Assignment

As Jeff would say, 'Don't talk about it, be about it'

### Job Stalking Assignment

There's an old saying - every company in tech is either hiring or in danger of going belly up.

There's another old saying - literally every tech company wants a senior developer with 5 years of experience in a framework that's 1 year old.

Do _not_ wait to pursue a company just because you haven't seen them post a 'Looking for a Junior Developer' ad. You'll be waiting a long time.

Instead - [revisit this assignment that you did earlier in the module](assignments/job-hunting.markdown)

If you already profiled companies, how many can you now take off your list? What companies are you more interested in checking out?

Review the data you already collected, collect data for new companies to fill in the blanks on companies you removed from your list. By profiling companies, you're armed with a lot of different ways to get them to notice you. You may also find that a company you were 'meh' about is actually sounding better and better the more you learn about it.

### The 'Open Source' Assignment

One of the best ways to get noticed, make friends, influence people, make things that help other people and continue learning is contributing to open source projects.

## The 'Community Involvement' Assignment

For a community of people who stereotypically like to work in a dark room, alone, hitting keyboard keys - community involvement sure is a big deal in the world of development.

### The 'YOLO LITERALLY ALL I WANT TO DO IS CODE' assignment

Maybe you don't _like_ planning for your future, maybe you just like to code and not write things, maybe you don't want us creeping on your future plans, man. It's cool. I get it.

## In Summation

What we've asked you to do in Module 4 is:
  - Learn a new language
  - Become better at using that language than many people who get paid to write it
  - Work with ambiguity
  - Do all of the above while not burning out after ~5 months of going really hard

[Zach Holman put it best in this tweet](https://twitter.com/holman/status/706006896273063936)

You should be incredibly proud that you are sitting here, reading this lesson right now.

Every single person on staff at Turing is rooting for you to succeed.

(Except for Jorge. Jorge thinks you're a punk.)

Go forth and continue to make us all proud.
