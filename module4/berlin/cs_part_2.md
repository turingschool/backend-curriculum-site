In today's session you'll split into three groups to work through three 50-minute segments.

## Warmup

* Take a lettered post-it note from the instructor table and sit wherever you like. It'll be temporary, so don't unpack or get settled in.
* In the minutes before we start, discuss the following with one or more persons at your table:
   1. How did your pairing exercise go last week when the pairs didn't have the same background knowledge?
   2. Consider that most of your pairing up to this point has been with people with similar expertise to your own. What will it be like on the job if your team uses pair programming?
   3. What do you think it takes for a pair to be successful collaborators?
   4. What do you do if a pairing goes off track?
   5. Who benefits from pair programming?
