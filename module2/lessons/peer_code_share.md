## Learning Goals
* Use appropriate technical language when describing code.
* Give and receive feedback on code.

In this lesson, we will review User Stories 5, 7, 10, and 11 of the [Relational Rails](https://backend.turing.edu/module2/projects/relational_rails/) solo project. First, we will share our code and discuss the user stories in small groups. Then, we will come together as a class and address any questions, struggles, or points of confusion that come up during the small group share. Here are some things to keep in mind as you work in your groups:

* Someone should be screen-sharing their code as you talk through a user story. Feel free to switch to other screens as needed. You should avoid talking about code without also looking at code. Everyone should share at least once.
* For each story, make sure to touch on the feature test(s), the model testing (if any), routes, controllers, models, and views.
* You may have not completed one or more of the user stories, and that’s okay! As your classmates share, be sure to follow along and ask questions. This is a collaborative effort.
* As you work, be sure to write down any questions that come up so that we can discuss them as a whole group later in the session. Don’t spend too much time on any 1 topic. If your group can’t answer it quickly, write it down and move on to the next topic.
* Note: If your group has not completed one or more of the stories, feel free to swap for one you can all discuss!

## Check For Understanding
1. What is something that you learned during this Code Share, that you'd like to take with you going forward? 
2. What's something you'd like to refactor about your project, if you have the time?
