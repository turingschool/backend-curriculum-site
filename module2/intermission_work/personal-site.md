# Build a Personal Site

Use the HTML and CSS skills you learned to build yourself a personal blog site.

At minimum, your site should contain an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and a first blog post about your Mod 1 experience and your favorite technical concept: `insert-first-post-title-here.html`. Push your project to Github Pages using [these instructions as for one using Jekyll](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/jekyll-blog-github-pages/pushing-project-to-gh-pages.markdown) (even though you're not using Jekyll).

*Note:* styling your personal site could take you months if you let it. The purpose of this assignment is for you to get additional experience with HTML/CSS, *not* to have a perfect looking personal site. You can (and should!) continue to tweak this site over time, but please limit the time you spend on this during intermission so that you can complete the remaining intermission work.

Once you have a functioning site that meets the requirements, submit them for review. If you absolutely can't leave it alone, feel free to continue working on this during breaks from your other work, but please understand that this is not required.
