## Deliverables:

First, create a new [Gist on Github](https://gist.github.com/). Copy and paste the markdown from [this template](https://gist.github.com/mikedao/cf0f63490a0ef91ac7d251e95fc410f7) into your gist.

This Gist will be your submission for your intermission work. Each of the assignments includes a Check for Understanding that you must complete in your Gist. Some of the assignments will also ask you to include a link to a GitHub repo.

**Deliverables are due 5:00 pm the Saturday before the module begins. Prework must be completed in its entirety in order to be successful in Mod 2.**


## Assignments

Work on the following assignments in order. Each assignment will assume that you have completed the previous one and the accompanying Checks for Understanding. **Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.0.6.x are required.**

Time-box recommendations are in each section's instructions, and also included here for convenience. 
1. Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), using your `@turing.edu` email address. 
   - This step sometimes takes a few days for GitHub to complete, but once you sign up for your credits you'll be able to take advantage of their benefits! 
   - Follow [these instructions](https://mod4.turing.edu/lessons/intermission/gh-student-instructions.html) to get the info you require to complete registration. **You do NOT need to complete the Heroku steps at this time!** Ask in #codehelp if you get stuck. 
2. [Ruby and Rails versions installation guide](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/misc/ruby_and_rails_versions)
3. [Get Module 2 Tools](./tools)
4. [Intro to LinkedIn](./linkedin)
5. Styling (2 hrs total)
    * [Intro to HTML](./html) (1h)
    * [Intro to CSS](./css) (1h)
    * STRICTLY TIME BOX THESE EXPLORATIONS. You will only need to know extremely basic HTML and CSS in this mod.
6. [Intro to SQL](./sql) (6 hrs total, 2 hrs each section)
7. [Rails Tutorial: Task Manager](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task_manager_rails) (Until complete)
8. [Optional: Static Challenge](./static_challenge) (2h - strict timebox. Focus on process/problem-solving rather than completion)

### If you are Repeating

Do a modified version of the assignments above:

* [Intro to SQL](./sql) (3-4 hrs total, 1 hr each section)
    * You can skip the Jumpstart Lab tutorial if you like. You can use the Checks for Understanding as a gauge of whether you need to review it or not.
    * Work on the SQL exercises. Spend at least 1 hour in all three sections.
    * Complete the Checks for Understanding
* [Task Manager](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task_manager_rails)
    * Review your code. If you do not have a copy, use the completed repo linked at the bottom of the README.
    * Answer the Checks for Understanding at the end of the README.
* Complete a timed [Static Challenge](./static_challenge) (2 hrs)
    * If you did Challenge 1 the first time, do Challenge 2, and vice versa.
    * STRICTLY TIMEBOX THIS ACTIVITY. DO NOT EXCEED 2 HOURS. Focus on your process and specific HTML/CSS troubleshooting skills. We do not care if you complete this challenge. 
    * As you work, reference the [W3Schools HTML5 Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [W3Schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
