title: Relational Rails
---

## Learning Goals

* Design a one to many relationship using a schema designer
* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
* Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
* Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers
* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior

## Requirements

- must use Rails 5.2.x
- must use PostgreSQL
- must "handroll" all routes (no use of `resources` syntax)

## Permission

- if there is a specific gem you'd like to use in the project that is not mentioned in this project page, you must permission from your instructors first

## Rubric


| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **Database Design** | **ActiveRecord** | **Testing and Debugging** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **4: Exceptional**  | All User Stories 100% complete including edge cases, and at least one extension story completed | Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code. | Clear schema design with detailed and accurate diagram. Migration history reflects table alterations not taught in class. All data types in the schema make logical sense. | Inheritance is utilized to DRY up duplicate queries. | 100% coverage for features and models. Either a gem that enhances testing effectiveness is implemented (orderly, factorybot, faker, etc) or within blocks are used throughout tests. |
| **3: Passing** | Students complete all User Stories. No more than 2 Stories fail to correctly implement functionality. | Students can defend any of their design decisions. Routing is organized and consistent and demonstrates use of some RESTful principles. Students can describe how data is passed in their application.| Relationships modeled in the database correctly. Appropriate use of foreign keys. Schema design accurately represents actual database schema and design document is linked in the README | ActiveRecord helpers are utilized whenever possible. ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data. No Ruby is used to process data. All queries functional and accurately implemented.| 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. Students can point to the difference between integration and unit testing. |
| **2: Passing with Concerns** | Students fail to complete 3-5 User Stories. | Students cannot defend some of their design decisions. Students inaccurately describe how some of their data is passed through their application. Routes don't demonstrate any use of RESTful design. | Some errors in database schema. Schema diagram lacks detail or accurate representation in database. | Ruby is used to process data that could use ActiveRecord instead. Some instances where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. Some queries not accurately implemented. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective. |
| **1: Failing** | Students fail to complete 6 or more User Stories. | Students do not effectively organize code. | Poor diagram design. Relationships do not make sense or not accurately modeled in the database. Many errors in database schema. | Ruby is used to process data more often than ActiveRecord. Many cases where ActiveRecord helpers are not utilized. | Below 90% coverage for either features or models. |

## Relationships

### Design your database  

Read [this lesson plan](https://backend.turing.edu/module2/lessons/one_to_many_relationships) and use it as a reference when designing your database.

Each person will come up with their own one to many relationship. This should represent a real world example of your choice. An example would be:
- Shelters and Pets
- A Shelter has many Pets
- A Pet belongs to one Shelter.

Do not use Parent/Child as your relationship

These relationships are yours to create, but we instructors are happy to provide feedback on the relationships if asked.

Use [This database design site](https://www.dbdesigner.net/) to design your database with your one to many relationships.

Here is an example diagram:

![Example Design](../misc/images/adopt_dont_shop_db_design.png)

You can create as many columns on each table as you would like, but we need a few columns represented on each table:

1. One string column for a 'name'
1. One boolean column
1. One numeric column
1. Two DateTime columns: created_at and updated_at

A couple of things to keep in mind as you're designing your schema:

* Foreign Keys do not count as an integer column
* You should not create columns that duplicate data. For example, in Pets/Shelters, a Shelter should not store a "pet_count" column since the count of Pets can also be found by counting the number of associated pets

**Schema Design will be reviewed at our first check-in**

## User Stories

In these stories, we will refer to the "one" side of the relationship as the "parent" and the "many" side of the relationship as the "children/child". In the Pets/Shelters example, Shelter would be the Parent and Pets would be the Children.

Children can be associated to the Parent. Children belong to a parent. Anywhere you see `child_table_name` think `pets` from our Pets and Shelters example.

Each user story will focus on one of the following:

**ActiveRecord**

**CRUD Functionality**

**Usability**: Users should be able to use the site easily. This means making sure there are links/buttons to reach all parts of the site and the styling/layout is sensible.
