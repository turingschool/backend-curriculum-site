title: Bulk Discounts - Evaluations
---


## Evaluation
This evaluation will be live with one instructor. 

Please be ready to walk through the front-end of your app, demonstrating how to add a bulk discount, editing that discount, and seeing the overall revenue change between invoice(s). 

Then, we will walk through the same steps in your code and tests. Be ready to answer questions from your instructor about how you came up with your solution, and how you might refactor. 



## Rubric

| | **Feature Completeness** | **Rails** | **Querying** | **Testing and Debugging**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| --- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exceptional**  | One or more additional extension features complete. | Students implement strategies not discussed in class and can defend their design decisions (callbacks, scopes, application_helper view methods are created, etc) | ActiveRecord methods are utilized whenever possible. ActiveRecord is used in a clear and effective way to read/write data including use of grouping, aggregating, and joining. | Very clear Test Driven Development. Test files are extremely well organized and nested. Students can point to multiple examples of edge case testing that are not included in the user stories. |
| **Meets Expectations** | Bulk discount is 100% complete| Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code with only 1 - 2 infractions. Routes and Actions mostly follow RESTful conventions | SQL or AR queries are functional and accurate.  Grouping, aggregating, and joining is used to process data at least once. No Ruby is used to process data where a query will suffice. | 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. All tests passing. TDD Process is clear throughout commits. Some sad path and edge case testing. Tests utilize within blocks to target specific areas of a page. |
| **Approaching Expectations** | One to two of the completion criteria for Bulk Discount features are not complete | Students utilize MVC to organize code, but cannot defend some of their design decisions. 3 or more infractions are present. RESTful conventions are only sometimes followed. | Ruby is used to process data that could be included in a query instead. Some instances where ActiveRecord methods are not utilized effectively. Some queries not accurately implemented. | Feature test coverage between 90% and 98%, or model test coverage below 100%, or tests are not meaningfully written or have an unclear objective, or tests do not utilize within blocks. Missing sad path or edge case testing.                                |
| **Below Expectations** | More than two of the completion criteria for Bulk Discount feature is incomplete| Students do not effectively organize code using MVC. | Ruby is used to process data more often than querying. Many cases where ActiveRecord methods are not utilized.| Below 90% coverage for either features or models. TDD was not used.
