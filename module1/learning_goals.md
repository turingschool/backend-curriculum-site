Academic success in BEM1 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

**Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
**Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
**Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate

A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.

## Design

**Mastery:**

* Students will be able to explain the difference between state and behavior and how these concepts are implemented in Ruby

* Students will be able to utilize Test Driven Development to drive the design of the code.

* Students will able to break down a large technical challenge in to manageable tasks using techniques such as whiteboarding and pseudocode

* Students will be able to explain the Single Responsibility and DRY principles and adhere to these principles in their code.

* Students will be able to write readable code with the following characteristics:
  * Variable and method names are self explanatory
  * Methods are under 7 lines
  * Lines of code are under 80 characters
  * Project directory structure adheres to convention
  * A linter reports less than 5 errors

* Students will be able to limit use of Instance Variables so that they only convey the state of an object

**Functional:**

* Students will be able to identify use cases for Modules and Inheritance

## Testing

**Mastery:**

* Students will be able to identify what they should test for in order to verify the expected behavior of a program

* Students will be able to accurately test a piece of functionality by writing appropriate Minitest assertions

* Students will be able to name and order tests so that a test file reads like documentation

* Students will be able to translate technical specifications into tests

* Students will be able to write a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass

**Functional:**

* Students will be able to explain what edge case testing is and write tests for those edge cases

* Students will be able to explain the difference between unit and integration testing, and write both types of tests

**Familiar:**

* Students will be able to explain the purpose of Mocks and Stubs

## Debugging

**Mastery:**

* Students will be able to explain the meaning of common Ruby error messages

* Students will be able to use Pry to create breakpoints in their code

**Functional:**

* Students will be able to utilize the Ruby Docs and other online resources to aid in debugging


## Version Control

**Mastery:**

* Students will be able to explain the difference between remote and local repositories

* Students will be able to push, pull, commit, and branch using the git command line interface

* Students will be able to commit code in small chunks of functionality

* Students will be able to submit and merge Pull Requests using the Github interface

## Desktop Environment

**Mastery:**
