Notes:

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:

The student:

- [ ] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [ ] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ ] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

The student:

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] utilizes Test Driven Development to drive the design of the code.
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing

Notes:

The student:

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] translates technical specifications into tests
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Debugging

Notes:

The student:

  - [ ] diagnoses and fixes bugs
  - [ ] reads and understands error messages
  - [ ] effectively uses Pry to create breakpoints in their code when/if appropriate
  - [ ] uses the Ruby Docs and other online resources to aid in debugging when appropriate

## Desktop Environment

Notes:

The student:

- [ ] utilizes keyboard shortcuts to improve workflow and minimize mouse use
- [ ] effectively uses the command line to navigate the machine to write and run Ruby programs
