- [ ] implements appropriate enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [ ] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow

- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately

    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention

## Testing

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
