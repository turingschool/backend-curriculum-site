### Review Items:

- Week 1 IC
- Week 2 IC
- Week 3 Mid Mod
  - Morning Prompt & Afternoon Prompt

### Ruby Exercises:
- [Reaching Through Objects](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/tree/main/objects-and-methods)

### New Items:
- Weeks 1-4 [Practice ICs](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/practice_assessments#practice-independent-challenges)
- Week 5 Practice ICs
  - Although this will cover topics you may not be familiar with yet, it might be good to challenge yourself to see where you are now vs. what you'll need to know for the end of the mod.

#### Other Week 1-2-3 Projects:
Note: If you choose to do other projects over a break, set the expectation that you may not finish, but that it would still be a good time to practice TDD/OOP conventions in a project-like setting.
