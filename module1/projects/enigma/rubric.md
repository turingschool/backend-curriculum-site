**Functionality** | Cracking method and command line interface successfully implemented | Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented | One of the following are not successfully implemented: Eniga#encrypt, Enigma#decrypt, command line interfaces | Two or more of the following are not successfully implemented: Eniga#encrypt, Enigma#decrypt, command line interfaces
**Object Oriented Programming** | Project includes a module and/or superclass that could be used outside of the Enigma project. All methods are less than 8 lines of code, all classes are less than 100 lines, and all lines of code are less than 80 characters. At least one class demonstrates a good use of class methods. Variable and method names always clearly communicate purpose. | Project is broken into logical components consisting of at least 4 classes that have single responsibilities. No more than 2 methods are longer than 7 lines. No class is longer than 100 lines. While there may be 1 or 2 lapses, variable and method names clearly communicate purpose. | Project is broken into logical components that include 2 or 3 classes that have single responsibilities. No more than 4 methods are longer than 7 lines. One class may be longer than 100 lines. Several variables or methods have a purpose that is not immediately obvious due to poor naming. | Project is not broken into logical components. 0 or 1 classes demonstrate single responsibility. More than 4 methods are longer than 7 lines. Variables and methods often have a purpose that is not immediately obvious due to poor naming.
**Test Driven Development** | All test names clearly communicate the purpose of the test. At least one test implements mocks and stubs. Test coverage metrics show 100% coverage | Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater. | Every method is not tested. git history does not demonstrate students are writing tests before implementation code. | Less than half of the methods in any given class are untested or have tests that don't verify expected behavior.
**Version Control** | At least 40 commits. At least 15 pull requests that are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. No commits include multiple pieces of functionality. No commit message is ambiguous. | At least 30 commits. At least 10 pull requests. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality. | 20 - 30 commits. 5 - 9 pull requests. No more than 5 commits include multiple pieces of functionality. | Less than 20 commits. Less than 5 pull requests. More than 5 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
