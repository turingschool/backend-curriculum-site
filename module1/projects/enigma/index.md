### Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Build classes that demonstrate single responsibilities
* Test drive a well-designed Object Oriented solution
* Work with file i/o

### Overview

In this project you'll use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm. Make sure you understand the Encryption Algorithm and plan out what classes you may need prior to starting.

Additionally, you will self assess your project before your evaluation. Make sure you read through the Evaluation Rubric prior to beginning so that you know what is expected of this project.
