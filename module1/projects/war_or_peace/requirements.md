_[Back to Project Home](./index)_


In order to help you to organize your project, we have broken the requirements into four separate iterations. It is expected that you will complete iterations 1-3, while 4 includes extensions that represent opportunities to further explore.

* [Iteration 1](./iteration1)
* [Iteration 2](./iteration2)
* [Iteration 3](./iteration3)
* [Iteration 4](./iteration4)

In addition to the functionality outlined in these iterations, we will expect you to do the following:

* write tests for each class
* write readable code
* make frequent commits
* use pull requests

For more detailed information about what we expect, please review the [rubric](./rubric) before starting this project!
