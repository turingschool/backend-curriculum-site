## Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Distinguishing between classes and instances of those classes
* Use and implement iteration or recursion techniques
* Host code on Github


<br>

<br> | **Exceeds Expectations** | **Meets Expectations** | **Approaching Expectations** | **Below Expectations**
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | Complete both extensions of iteration 4. | Complete through Iteration 3 and functions as defined by the project requirements. | Up to Iteration 2 is complete or the application does not exactly follow the requirements outlined in the specification. | Iteration 2 is not complete. |
**Ruby Mechanics** | Project includes appropriate uses of datatypes and methods not covered in class | Appropriately uses Ruby's built in datatypes and methods and flow control. | Does not appropriately use one or two of the following: Ruby's built in datatypes and methods or flow control | Does not appropriately use Ruby's built in datatypes and methods or flow control, or does not build classes |
**Ruby Conventions** | Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. | Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention | Code demonstrates some proper indenting and spacing. Class, method, variable, and file names inconsistently follow convention | Code is not properly indented and spaced and lines are excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names do not follow convention |
**Testing** | All methods are accurately tested. Best use assertions are made. Edge cases are tested. | Each class has its own test file. Every method listed on the specification is tested. Most tests are written to accurately verify expected behavior. | Tests are written for most methods listed on the specification, but the tests may be in an incorrect location or the tests may not accurately verify the expected behavior | Fewer than 7 tests written |
**Version Control** | At least 30 commits. At least 3 pull requests. Commit messages and Pull Request documentation clearly indicate changes made. | Code is hosted on main branch of Github repository. At least 20 commits. At least 1 pull request. | Code is hosted on Github, but has fewer than 20 commits or has no pull requests | Code is not hosted on Github |
