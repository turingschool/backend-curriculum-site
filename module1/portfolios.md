title: M1 Portfolio Requirements
---

## Purpose

* **Acknowledging Progress:** portfolios give students the opportunity to understand their own progress in pursuit of their career as a software developer.
* **Practicing Narrative:** portfolio presentation pushes students to articulate their narrative of their technical and professional journey.
* **Direct Feedback:** portfolio feedback allows students to receive a summative perspective of their performance, including threads of successes and areas of growth.

## Structure

* Student-directed presentation (5 minutes)
* Instructor feedback (5 minutes)

## Requirements

Each student will deliver a 5 minute slide presentation in front of your instructors.

* All students will respond to the following prompt:
  * How has feedback impacted your development in this module?
  * How has feedback conversations with peers helped prepare you for your job/career?
  * What is something you've learned about yourself in receiving project feedback?
  * What has been the most valuable piece of feedback you have received?
  * What specific actions are you planning on taking after receiving the feedback from this inning?

* A student who **will repeat the current module** uses their presentation time to explore why they struggled, discuss the lessons learned, and lay out a plan for what will be different next time.
* A student who is **repeating unsuccessfully** and will leave the program is excused from the presentation and can use the entire portfolio time for feedback and discussion.
* A student who **passes the module** will present the following:
  * How does your past experience link to your work at Turing and in the eventual career?
  * Why are you motivated to become a software developer?
  * Reflecting on your career journal from the module, what’s your current vision for a successful career in the software industry?
  <!-- * How will your Gear Up sessions impact you as a software developer? -->



#### The presentation should not be a series of slides that directly answers each of these questions with bullet points, but instead should:

* Follow a narrative format -- this is an opportunity to fine tune your story and how you speak about your work. Slides should flow naturally from one to the next.
* Include images and graphics to illustrate the concepts you plan to discuss. These may include screenshots/animated gifs of an application you created, snippets of code from your projects, diagrams of interesting concepts/structures that you used in your project(s).

## Submittal

* Students are not required to submit any documents but instead should be prepared to give their presentation to their instructors and engage in a follow up conversation.

## Potential Outcomes

* If everything goes to plan: good luck in next mod!
* If a student fails to present a portfolio (due to illness, etc): need to present it in Week 1 of the next inning
* If a student delivers an exceptionally poor portfolio: we'll determine next steps, possible PIP, etc
