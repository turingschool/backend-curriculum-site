## Guest Speaker: Krista Morgan (9:00 - 10:00)
*Guaranty Bank, S300*  

Krista Morgan ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristamorgan) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/krismtl) ) is cofounder and CEO of P2Binvestor, a Denver-based crowdlending platform that provides working capital financing to growing businesses. In less than 2 years since P2Binvestor went to market with its lending and investment platform, Krista has grown the company from an idea into a multimillion-dollar company, a thriving online marketplace, and one of the few tech-enabled commercial lenders that can underwrite and fund large, million-dollar lines of credit in a few days. Before founding a financial technology company, she worked in digital marketing and managed accounts for major brands such as Coca-Cola and Barclays at some of London's top digital agencies, and earlier in her career she managed operations for a custom motorcycle frame manufacturer. Krista hails from Montreal, earned a degree in economics from McGill University, and is the cohost of Women Who Startup Radio, a biweekly podcast for and about women entrepreneurs. She has a commitment to and passion for mentoring other women entrepreneurs, helping business owners understand finance options at different growth stages, and teaching others about fundraising and scaling a startup.


### Talk Overview

Krista will discuss building a technical team, what she looks for, and what problems P2Binvestor is solving in the investment world with technology (constraints vs. opportunities).
